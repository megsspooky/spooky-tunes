# ✨ Spooky Tunes – GAN-Inspired Chaos by @megsspooky

This notebook generates random "fake" images using pure noise and a splash of color — a baby step into the world of GANs and generative AI.

Built with:
- 🧠 `numpy` – for that sweet, sweet random matrix magic
- 🎨 `matplotlib` – for visualizing pixel chaos

---

## 🔮 What does it do?
It creates a 64x64 grid of random values and paints it with a color palette. It’s simple, trippy, and GAN-inspired — a soft launch into generative art.

You can run it directly in Google Colab:

## 🌱 What’s next?
- Add color map toggles (`plasma`, `inferno`, `gray`, `twilight`)
- Experiment with higher/lower resolutions
- Connect this project to real GAN outputs down the line
